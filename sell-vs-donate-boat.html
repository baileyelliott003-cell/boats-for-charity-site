Donating May Be the Better Option</h1>
<p>If you’re trying to <strong>sell your boat</strong>, you already know it can take weeks or months—messages, tire-kickers, storage, and repairs.</p>
<p>For many owners, <strong>donating a boat</strong> is a faster, simpler alternative that also supports a good cause.</p>
<h2>Why selling a boat is harder than most people expect</h2>
<ul>
<li>Time spent listing, showing, and negotiating</li>
<li>Low offers and no-shows</li>
<li>Marina/storage costs while it sits</li>
<li>Repair requests after inspections</li>
</ul>
<h2>When donating a boat makes more sense than selling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your boat won’t sell or you’re tired of relisting</li>
<li>The boat needs repairs or it’s not worth putting money into</li>
<li>You want it gone without dealing with buyers</li>
<li>You want your boat to create real impact</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you should NOT donate your boat</h2>
