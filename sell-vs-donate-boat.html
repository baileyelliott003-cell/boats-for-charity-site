  <h1>Thinking About Selling Your Boat? Read This First</h1>
  <p>If you’re trying to sell your boat and it’s turning into a headache (buyers no‑showing, low offers, storage fees, repairs), donating can be the simpler option.</p>

  <h2>Why selling a boat is harder than most people expect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Listing, messages, and showing the boat takes time.</li>
    <li>Many buyers want a sea trial, inspections, or price cuts.</li>
    <li>Storage, registration, and maintenance keep costing you while it sits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When donating makes more sense than selling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You want it gone fast without dealing with buyers.</li>
    <li>The boat needs work, and you don’t want to fix it first.</li>
    <li>You’re paying storage/marina fees and want to stop the bleed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Selling vs donating</h2>
  <div class="table-wrap">
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Selling</th><th>Donating</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Weeks to months (sometimes longer)</td><td>Often much faster</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Meetups, negotiations, and paperwork</td><td>We guide you through the donation paperwork</td></tr>
        <tr><td>May need repairs to get “sellable”</td><td>Boats in many conditions can still qualify</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

  <h2>How Boats for Charity helps</h2>
  <p>We make boat donation straightforward. Tell us about your boat, we’ll explain next steps, and if it’s a fit we’ll help you move forward with paperwork and the donation process.</p>

  <h2>When you should NOT donate</h2>
  <p>If your boat is in excellent condition and you can sell it quickly for a strong price, selling may be the better choice. If selling isn’t worth the time or stress, donating can be the easier path.</p>
