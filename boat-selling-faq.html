  <h1>Boat Selling FAQ</h1>
  <p>Quick answers for people trying to sell a boat — and when donating may be the better option.</p>

  <h2>Can I donate a boat instead of selling it?</h2>
  <p>Yes. If selling is taking too long or the boat needs work, donating can be a simpler way to move on while supporting a good cause.</p>

  <h2>What if my boat won’t sell?</h2>
  <p>If you’re getting low offers, no‑shows, or the boat has been listed for weeks, donating is often a practical alternative.</p>

  <h2>Do you take boats that need repairs?</h2>
  <p>Often, yes. Tell us the condition and we’ll let you know if it’s a fit.</p>

  <h2>Do I need a trailer?</h2>
  <p>Not always. Let us know what you have and where the boat is located.</p>

  <h2>Will I get a receipt?</h2>
  <p>Yes. We provide donation documentation/receipt for your records. (Talk to a tax professional about your situation.)</p>
